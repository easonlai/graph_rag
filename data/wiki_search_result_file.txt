== Plot ==
Anti-Villain League (AVL) agent Gru attends a reunion at his alma mater, Lycée Pas Bon. There, he reunites with his rival Maxime Le Mal, who harbors a grudge with Gru for stealing his talent show act when they were in school. Maxime reveals he has enhanced himself with cockroach parts to make himself over-powered and so can conquer the world, but Gru arrests him with the help of the AVL. Maxime escapes from the AVL prison with the help of his girlfriend Valentina. He reveals an invention that turns people into human-roach hybrids, which he plans to specifically use on Gru's infant son Gru Jr.
Silas Ramsbottom comes out of retirement and visits the Gru household to inform them of Maxime's escape; and that the AVL will have to relocate them to a house in another town named Mayflower until Maxime is recaptured. Assuming new names and identities as part of a witness protection program, Gru becomes Chet, a solar panel salesman. Lucy is given the name Blanche and a career as a hairdresser. Most of the Minions are taken in by the AVL. Silas selects five of them to be augmented with powers under an initiative called the Megaminions, but the initiative is canceled after the group causes collateral damage in a city.
In their new well-off residential town, Gru and his family meet their neighbors, the Prescotts. Their teenage daughter, Poppy, an aspiring villainess, recognizes Gru from his former career as a villain. She threatens to blow Gru's cover unless he helps her pull off a heist to steal Lycée Pas Bon's mascot, a honey badger named Lenny, so she can enroll there. The pair, with the help of two Minions and Gru Jr., successfully steal Lenny. The school's elderly principal, Frau Übelschlecht, identifies Gru from security cam footage and contacts Maxime to inform him of Gru's whereabouts, using a tracker in Lenny's collar.

Longtime supervillain Felonious Gru has his pride hurt when an unknown rival steals the Great Pyramid of Giza. Gru, his elderly assistant Dr. Nefario, and his army of Minions devise a plan to steal the Moon. Seeking financial assistance, Gru approaches Mr. Perkins, the director of the Bank of Evil, who orders Gru to procure a shrink ray. While at the bank, Gru meets Vector, the budding supervillain responsible for the Pyramid heist. Gru and two of his Minions obtain the shrink ray from a research base, only for Vector to ambush them and steal it for himself.
After failing to infiltrate Vector's fortress, Gru notices three orphan girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, being allowed into the fortress to sell cookies to Vector. Gru adopts the girls under the guise of a dentist, using them to distract Vector while he reclaims the shrink ray. He tries to abandon the girls at an amusement park, but starts to bond with them. Gru later shows Perkins the shrink ray through a video call, only to be met with rejection. Observing Gru's despair, the girls offer him their piggy bank, and the Minions pool their resources to fund the moon heist. Meanwhile, Perkins berates Vector, his son, for losing the shrink ray, but Vector assures his father of his ability to thwart Gru's plan. Dr. Nefario calculates the day when the Moon is closest to Earth, which unfortunately coincides with the girls' ballet recital. Believing the girls are a distraction to Gru, Nefario calls the orphanage's owner, Miss Hattie, to take the girls back. Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon. Hoping to make it to the recital on time, he rushes back to Earth, but finds that Vector has kidnapped the girls.
Arriving at Vector's fortress, Gru surrenders the Moon to Vector, but Vector refuses to give back the girls. Enraged, Gru storms Vector's fortress, intent on revenge.

== Plot ==
Married Anti-Villain League (AVL) agents Felonious Gru and Lucy Wilde are sent to recover the stolen Dumont Diamond from Balthazar Bratt, a former child star who became a supervillain after his show, Evil Bratt, was canceled. Gru recovers the diamond, while Bratt escapes. At the AVL headquarters, director Silas Ramsbottom announces his retirement, and appoints board member Valerie Da Vinci as the new director. Da Vinci dismisses Gru and Lucy from the AVL, believing they should have captured Bratt during the mission.
When Gru and Lucy return home, they tell their adopted daughters Margo, Edith, and Agnes of their dismissal, but assure them they will soon have new jobs. When Gru refuses to return to being a supervillain, and with his assistant Dr. Nefario accidentally frozen in carbonite, most of his Minions, led by Mel, abandon him to find new jobs. They eventually land in jail after accidentally crashing into a television studio.
A butler named Fritz arrives at Gru's home with an invitation from his long-lost twin brother Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia. The family travels to meet Dru, and are surprised by his immense wealth and mansion. Meanwhile, Bratt steals the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot that will destroy Hollywood, as revenge for his show's cancelation. Dru reveals to Gru that their late father was a supervillain known as "the Bald Terror", whose villainous activities and technological advances are the real source of the family's wealth. Dru wants Gru to teach him how to become a villain, but Gru refuses to revert to his old ways. While Lucy struggles with her new tasks as a mother, Dru and Gru become closer after joyriding in their father's high-tech vehicle.
Gru and Dru decide to steal the diamond; however, Gru secretly intends to bring it to the AVL to convince Da Vinci to rehire him and Lucy.

In return, Gru berates Dru for his incompetence, disowns him, and decides to leave Freedonia.
Bratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the girls, and once again acquires the diamond. Discovering this, Gru and Dru put aside their differences; the brothers and Lucy set off after Bratt in the Bald Terror's vehicle.

== Plot ==
A mysterious aircraft steals a highly potent mutagen known as PX-41 from a laboratory in the Arctic Circle. Silas Ramsbottom, director of the Anti-Villain League (AVL), sends agent Lucy Wilde to recruit former supervillain Gru, who is forcibly brought to their headquarters and asked to help them track down the culprit and recover the mutagen. However, Gru refuses and informs Silas and Lucy that he has enough responsibilities as a father and as the owner of a jelly-producing business. Later, Dr. Nefario quits to accept a job offer to assist another villain; this causes a reluctant Gru to decide to work with the AVL after all. He and Lucy are partnered and stationed at a shopping mall, with a cupcake store as their front.
Gru immediately suspects that Mexican restaurant owner Eduardo Pérez might be "El Macho", a supervillain who was presumed dead after riding a shark into an active volcano with two hundred fifty pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest. That night, Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant, but find no evidence that Eduardo has done anything villainous. Meanwhile, Gru's three adopted daughters, Margo, Edith and Agnes, who dream of having a mother one day, believe that Gru will eventually fall in love with Lucy. Gru denies it, saying his relationship with Lucy is only professional.
Despite holding Eduardo as his prime suspect, Gru agrees to pursue other leads, including the shop of wig merchant Floyd Eaglesan, where Lucy discovers traces of the mutagen. After witnessing Eduardo's son, Antonio, woo Margo, Gru renews his focus on Eduardo, who in turn invites the family to his Cinco de Mayo party. Gru's neighbor, Jillian, sets him up on a blind date that goes wrong with Shannon, who tries to take Gru's wig, but Lucy saves Gru from embarrassment by shooting Shannon in the behind with a tranquilizer dart; Lucy helps Gru escape and the two form a friendship. The AVL arrests Floyd after finding an nearly-empty jar of the mutagen in his shop. Ramsbottom then closes the investigation and reassigns Lucy to Australia, leaving Gru heartbroken.
At Minions () are a fictional all-male species of yellow creatures that appear in Illumination's Despicable Me franchise. They are characterized by their childlike behavior and their language, which is largely unintelligible.
The Minions serve as the official mascots for Illumination and have also been described by The New York Times as "corporate icons" for Comcast in the years since their 2013 purchase of Illumination's parent company NBCUniversal; similar to Mickey Mouse for The Walt Disney Company or Mario for Nintendo.
Kevin, Stuart, and Bob are three of the most familiar minions, who appear as stars in the film Minions (2015) and its sequel Minions: The Rise of Gru (2022). Many other Minions are mentioned by name in the films and other media in the franchise. They were created by Eric Guillon, Pierre Coffin, and Chris Renaud.


== Characteristics ==
The Minions are small, yellow capsule-shaped creatures with round gray goggles. They are depicted as being roughly one-third to one-half the height of humans but they were later revealed to be 3 feet 7 inches (1.1 m) tall. They have one or two eyes, and their irises are almost always brown (except for Bob, who has one green and one brown eye). They have three fingers and toes per hand and foot. They have no discernible noses but seem capable of smelling, as they are shown smelling fruit and are affected by the Fart Gun. They are also shown without ears but can hear and respond to sounds.  Most Minions appear either bald or with a few wispy strands of black hair on their heads. After leaving their home country of Switzerland in favor of a new life in America during the late 1960s, their clothing consists of blue overalls emblazoned with Gru's logo, black rubber gloves, shoes, and goggles.
While shown as somewhat absent-minded and having very mischievous streaks, they also possess exceptional engineering abilities, being able to design and construct spaceships and playthings for Gru's adopted daughters, particularly the youngest, Agnes. The 2015 animated feature film Minions shows that they have existed since the beginning of life on Earth. Minions are biologically wired to seek out and serve villains – including notable fictional ones such as Count Dracula, and real-life historical figures like Napoleon – and when they have no "boss" to serve, the Minions become depressed and listless. They are also shown to have a degree of invulnerability, as Kevin, Stuart and Bob are able to survive a European torture chamber without any injuries, even playing with the torture devices, and to survive being hit by dropped heavy objects. In the 2010 short film "Banana", the Minions are revealed to have an almost uncontrollable craving for fruit, especially bananas.


== Language ==
The Minions speak in a fictional polyglot language, called Minionese, which features a combination of gibberish mixed with words from real languages such as but not limited to English, French, Spanish, Indonesian, Hindi, Korean, Filipino and Italian. Although seemingly nonsensical, the English-sounding dialogue is dubbed differently for every country, in order to make the sounds somewhat recognizable.  They have common English-language names, such as Dave (one of the first known minions in the franchise), Kevin, Stuart, Bob (the lead trio in Minions and Minions: The Rise of Gru), Mel (the leader of the Minions in Despicable Me 3 after Gru refuses their request to resume supervillainy), and Otto (the fourth lead Minion in Minions: The Rise of Gru).


== Derivatives ==

Since the release of the Despicable Me films, the Minions' popularity has been rising. The Minions have been regularly featured in cross-promotions for other Comcast/NBCUniversal properties, including Universal theme parks, NBC primetime TV series, and an Xfinity remote control.
"Minion versions" of the Simpson family appeared at the end of The Simpsons episode "Treehouse of Horror XXV", which aired on October 19, 2014.
The Minions appeared in three epis Despicable Me 4 (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) is the soundtrack accompanying the 2024 Illumination-produced animation film Despicable Me 4, the fourth main and the sixth overall installment in the Despicable Me franchise and a sequel to Despicable Me 3 (2017). Released through Back Lot Music on June 27, 2024, it featured 44 tracks, primarily based on the film's original score composed by Heitor Pereira and the cover of Tears for Fears' 1985 single "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" performed by the film's cast.


== Background ==
Heitor Pereira and Pharrell Williams renewed their association with Despicable Me 4 as composers; the former would score the original music and the latter would provide new songs and themes, while reusing his themes from the predecessors.


== Additional music ==
Despicable Me 4 featured three original songs written and recorded specifically for the film. On May 2024, Williams previewed the snippet of the song "Double Life" through his YouTube channel. He later released it as a single on June 14, 2024. The song was interpreted by critics as a diss track aimed at Canadian rapper Drake. The second single "Lil Mega Minion" by Lil Yachty was released on June 24, 2024, followed by the third song "None of Your Business" by Teezo Touchdown, two days later. However, those tracks were not released along with the soundtrack album.
The following songs were heard in the film, but not included in the soundtrack or separately released. Those include:

Lovia Gyarkye of The Hollywood Reporter called the music as "tense". Gary Goldstein Los Angeles Times wrote "Heitor Pereira returns to provide the film’s effective, at times eclectic score."

== Reception ==

Despicable Me: Minion Mayhem on Nintendo DS received "mixed or average" reviews according to review aggregator Metacritic.
Eurogamer contrasted the game with other video game adaptations of films, describing it as pleasant and contending that it used the capabilities of the DS well, while avoiding the pitfalls of other adaptations of reproducing the animated sequences from the film.
The Guardian described the game as challenging, if sloppy, praising the gameplay and the developers' use of the Despicable Me, license, but criticizing the game's difficulty and poor controls.
Nintendo Life said the game "commits no crime besides being very average", finding that the game had "spots of fun" despite generally criticizing the game and varying difficulty.

=== Reception ===
Tall Writer of Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote that "Solid entertainment and some education on the classics make the Despicable Me 3 original motion picture soundtrack a decent offering". Jordan Mintzer of The Hollywood Reporter called the songs as "catchy" and praised Williams' songs and "the music cues ranging from Michael Jackson to Van Halen to A-ha". Peter Debruge of Variety said "the movie can hardly find room for Heitor Pereira's funky score, and though Pharrell Williams has contributed five new songs to sell soundtracks (including the sweet 'There's Something Special'), the movie hardly needs them."
Wenlei Ma of News.com.au wrote about the use of 80s pop hits to equate Bratt's character, received praise and called that "audience might tap toes for the songs". Rotoscopers-based Morgan Stradling said "One thing that Despicable Me has always done well is a great soundtrack and these new tracks do not disappoint. They are catchy, upbeat and very much on brand for the franchise, especially since Pharrell Williams is at the helm yet again. While there isn’t a runaway hit like 'Happy' from the second film, the songs that are in the movie play well in the moment." The soundtrack received a mixed review from Soumya Srivatsava of Hindustan Times, who said "The soundtrack, with all the throwback hits from the ‘80s, gets you tapping your feet more often. However, even with all the work done by Pharell Williams on this one, he couldn’t deliver another Happy like last time."

Soundtracks for Despicable Me at Internet Movie Database Illumination, formerly known as Illumination Entertainment, is an American animation studio founded by Chris Meledandri in 2007 and is a division of Universal Pictures, a division of Comcast through its wholly owned subsidiary NBCUniversal; Meledandri produces the films, while Universal finances and distributes them. The studio is best known for creating the Despicable Me, The Secret Life of Pets, and Sing franchises, as well as the adaptations of Dr. Seuss' books The Lorax and How the Grinch Stole Christmas!; and Nintendo video games, starting with The Super Mario Bros. Movie. The Minions, characters from the Despicable Me series, are the mascots of the studio.
Illumination has produced 15 feature films, with an average gross of $711 million per film. The studio's highest-grossing films are The Super Mario Bros. Movie (2023; $1.362 billion), Minions (2015; $1.159 billion), and Despicable Me 3 (2017; $1.034 billion), all of which are among the 50 highest-grossing films of all time, and eight of their films are among the 50 highest-grossing animated films.


== History ==

Meledandri left as President of 20th Century Fox Animation and Blue Sky Studios in early 2007. While at those companies he supervised or executive-produced movies including Ice Age, Robots, Ice Age: The Meltdown, and Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who!. After leaving, he founded Illumination Entertainment and a deal was announced positioning Illumination Entertainment as Universal's family entertainment arm, that would produce one to two films a year starting in 2010. As part of the deal, Illumination retains creative control and Universal Pictures exclusively distributes the films.
In 2011, Illumination acquired the animation department of the French animation and visual effects studio Mac Guff, which animated Despicable Me and Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, and formed Illumination Mac Guff (later Illumination Studios Paris).
On August 22, 2016, NBCUniversal acquired competing studio DreamWorks Animation, which fueled speculation that Meledandri was to oversee both studios. While he had been approached by NBCUniversal to oversee both studios, he turned down the offer and later explained "I love the process of making films and working with artists. I don't think I'm particularly great at managing companies".
On September 23, 2022, Illumination announced its hiring of former Netflix head of adult animation Mike Moon as senior creative advisor, and a new label led by Moon known as Moonlight, which will aim to "produce animated films that push beyond the family genre".


== Process ==
In a similar fashion to Sony Pictures Animation and Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, Illumination does not produce its films in-house where it is based in Santa Monica, but rather outsources the animation production of its films to other studios. Most of its films are animated by Illumination Studios Paris, a subsidiary formed through the purchase of Mac Guff (which animated the first Despicable Me). So far, the only Illumination film not to be animated by Illumination Studios Paris or Mac Guff was Hop, which was animated by Rhythm & Hues Studios.
Not unlike Pixar, in its early days Illumination depended on a core group of directors and writers to create its films. The directors of Despicable Me, Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, also directed or co-directed Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, Despicable Me 2, Minions, The Secret Life of Pets, and Despicable Me 3. Screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (who had written Dr. Seuss' Horton Hears a Who! for Meledandri at Fox) wrote or co-wrote Despicable Me, Hop, Dr. Seuss' The Lorax, Despicable Me 2, The Secret Life of Pets, and Despicable Me 3, while screenwriter Brian Lynch wrote or co-wrote Hop, Minions, and The Secret Life of Pets.
Illumination's films generally have a budget between $60–80 million. Meledandri prefers to keep Illumination adhering to a low-cost model, recognising that "strict cost controls and hit animated films are not mutually exclusive". I Despicable Me 2: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack is the soundtrack album for the 2013 film Despicable Me 2; the sequel to Despicable Me (2010). The album was released on July 2, 2013, through Back Lot Music. The original music was composed by Heitor Pereira and Pharrell Williams, whom previously scored for Despicable Me. The soundtrack to the film featured 24 tracks – eight songs and the remainder of the album, consists of original score tracks. Out of the eight songs, three original tracks, written by Williams, were featured in the album as well as the tracks "Another Irish Drinking Song", "I Swear" and "Y.M.C.A." were incorporated into the album. Besides that, two tracks from Despicable Me: "Fun, Fun, Fun" and the titular track is also featured in the soundtrack.
The track "Happy" served as the only single from the album released on November 21, 2013, by Back Lot Music, and was also part of Williams' second studio album Girl (2014). A visual presentation of the track, being advertised as "the world's first 24-hour music video" coincided the single, featuring Williams and directed by We Are from LA, and went viral upon release. Besides, topping the charts in over 19 countries, it was the best-selling song of 2014 in the United States and United Kingdom. The song also received an Academy Award-nomination for Best Original Song at the 86th Academy Awards, but lost the award to "Let It Go" from Frozen. Eight years after the single release, the track "Just a Cloud Away" was released in March 2022.


== Background ==
The co-director of Despicable Me 2, Chris Renaud had recalled the "distinctive music of the first film" that born out of the collaboration between Pereira and Williams, leading them to work for its sequel. Pereira attributed that for El Macho, being a Mexican wrestler and the main antagonist, had to implement "full choir with a latin flair to emphasize his presence". Pereira also created new themes for the characters, including for the minions, whose themes needed to be "more threatening and menacing". Williams and Pereira discussed about several main themes for the album, and went ahead with the overarching theme, which was not about the characters but much about the air of the film. He added that the "continuity was honestly based on lifting people up emotionally".
Williams wrote three original songs, including the popular track "Happy" that was released as a single on November 21, 2013, to wider commercial success. In a 2014 interview to The New York Times, Williams recalled that the song was rejected nine times, by the producer Chris Meledandri, before finally being approved. While writing the track, did not write the melodic portions, but only just the chorus part of the film. He finished writing the song within 20 minutes. The song was initially intended to be written for CeeLo Green (who earlier sang another track "Scream"), but due to conflicts with CeeLo's record company Elektra Records, as he was on the verge of releasing his 2013 Christmas album, Williams himself sang the track, instead.
Speaking on the integration of the film songs into the score, Pereira said "Unless there is a reason in the story, you don't want it to be a surprise, so you have to tease the ears with what is going to come in the song before it begins".


== Promotions and marketing ==
As a part of promotions, Williams came up with a website 24hoursofhappy.com, launched to coincide with the single release, featuring a visual presentation of "Happy" advertised as being "the world's first 24-hour music video", directed by the French directing team We Are from LA. The video went viral upon its premiere, and attributed to the massive success of the song. The four-minute video edit of the song released on YouTube on November 21, and as of March 2018, it crossed over 1 billion views. Eight years after the film's release, Williams released the lyrical song "Just a Cloud Away" on March 25, 2022, to wider commercial response.

== References == Felonious Gru Sr., alternatively spelled as Felonius Gru and typically referred to simply as Gru, is a fictional character and the  protagonist of the Despicable Me franchise. Voiced by American actor Steve Carell, he has appeared in all six films in the series. Gru is a grouchy, quick-witted, and cynical former supervillain, who serves as a secret agent in order to fight other supervillains.


== Character biography ==

Gru is the son of Marlena and the Bald Terror (real name Robert), twin brother of Dru, the adoptive father of Margo, Edith, and Agnes as well as the biological father of Gru Jr., husband of Lucy, and boss of the Minions.
At the beginning of the first film, Gru is an ambitious supervillain who constantly seeks approval from his mother, until the adoption of his daughters convinces him that their happiness is the most important thing.
In the second film, Gru leaves his villainous past behind to care for his adoptive daughters, but then soon joins forces - unwillingly - with secret agent Lucy Wilde, whom he later marries.
In the third film, after he and Lucy are fired from their jobs at the Anti-Villain League, Gru learns that he has a twin brother, Dru, whom he never met due to their divorced parents raising each child separately. Along with Lucy and the girls, Gru meets Dru at his mansion in Freedonia, and they form a brotherly relationship over the course of the film.
In the fourth film, Gru has a blood-related son called Felonious Gru Jr., who he must protect from his rival Maxime Le Mal.


== Development ==
The character that would become Gru was conceived by animator Sergio Pablos, who envisioned him as a Dracula-like character, but the directors of the first film, Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, later opted for a more sleek character that would echo "the world of James Bond", with Auric Goldfinger being cited as a particular influence. Gru also bears some design similarities with British comic-book character Grimly Feendish and with the pre-Crisis version of Lex Luthor.
Gru's distinctive accent, described as "quasi-Russian" by A. O. Scott and "halfway between a Russian mafioso and a crazed Nazi" by Roger Ebert, was largely a product of his voice actor Steve Carell's experimentation. According to Despicable Me producer Chris Meledandri, the voice Carell eventually settled on was conceived as "halfway between Ricardo Montalbán and Bela Lugosi".


== Analysis ==
The use of flashbacks to characterise Gru in Despicable Me was compared by Variety to those used in Pixar's 2007 film Ratatouille to characterise Anton Ego. Gru was cited by Katy Marriner, writing in Screen Education, as one of the premier examples of a protagonist in an animated film who reforms themself, in contrast to the traditional animated film protagonist who remains heroic throughout. Gru was psychologically analysed by Nofika Dewi of Universitas Pamulang, who found that his rude and ambitious qualities represented his Id; his villainy and tenaciousness represented his Ego, while his competence as a parent and bravery were part of his Super-ego.
Gru has also been interpreted as a Russian stereotype, with a 2017 study stating that elements of his characterisation had been designed to support supposed American political agendas that label Russians as backwards and violent.

== Life and career ==
Chris Renaud was born in 1966 in Baltimore. At age 15, he moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania when his father, who worked for Bethlehem Steel, was transferred to their corporate headquarters. Renaud has said he had mixed feelings with the move, saying it upset him but it was also one of the best things in his life because it showed him "that there was a great, big world out there". He was the artist for the high school yearbooks and newspaper and had aspirations of creating comic books. He graduated Parkland High School in Allentown, Pennsylvania in 1985 and attended Baum School of Art in Allentown, where he received a $1,000 scholarship.
After graduating from Syracuse University with an illustration degree in 1989,  Renaud began work as a graphic designer in the sports entertainment industry. He has created logos and mascots for NFL Properties, the NBA, and Foot Locker. After working as a designer and illustrator for a variety of publications and agencies, Chris began drawing and writing comic books. Working for both Marvel Comics and DC Comics, his projects included illustrating Marvel's Starfleet Academy and pitching the story concept that evolved into Batman: Cataclysm which depicted a devastating earthquake hitting Gotham City. This yearlong tale across all Batman-related comics resulted in increased sales and visibility for the renowned character and set up the acclaimed "No Man's Land" storyline that followed.
As the production designer on the Disney Channel's The Book of Pooh, Renaud transitioned into the world of children's television. Since that groundbreaking project, he has been able to design virtual sets and puppet characters for Bear in the Big Blue House, LazyTown, Curious Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation. With It's a Big Big World, which aired from 2006 to 2010 on PBS, he took the lead in visual development and design of every aspect of this Emmy-nominated children's program.
Renaud worked for Blue Sky Studios as a story artist on the films Robots, Ice Age: The Meltdown, and the Dr. Seuss adaptation Horton Hears a Who!. He wrote and co-directed the animated short No Time for Nuts, which received an Annie Award and a 2007 Oscar nomination for animated short film. It was also included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2006.
Renaud moved to Paris to work for Illumination Entertainment. While directing Despicable Me (2010), Renaud, along with his directing partner Pierre Coffin, began to develop Gru's famous henchmen, the Minions. Initially, there were discussions about making the creatures robots. Then Renaud hit upon the notion that they could be mole people and slapped goggles on them. "I did a very rough, ugly, little sketch combining some elements into a mole person and sent it to Pierre, who then discussed it with Eric Guillon, who was the art director and final designer of the Minions, and they took some of those ideas and together we came up with what the Minions look like". The more the filmmakers worked on the little guys, the more yellow and more cylindrical they became. "Eric continued to refine the idea and made [the Minions] closer to children. He made them funnier and simpler and a brighter color". Among the inspirations for the Minions were th Pharrell Lanscilo Williams (; born April 5, 1973), often known mononymously as Pharrell, is an American singer, songwriter, rapper, record producer, and fashion designer.

He then signed with Virgin and Interscope Records to release his debut studio album, In My Mind (2006), which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 despite mixed critical reception. Williams produced and guest performed alongside T.I. on Robin Thicke's 2013 single "Blurred Lines", which peaked atop the Billboard Hot 100 and received diamond certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). That year, he won two Grammy Awards—Record of the Year and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance—for his appearance alongside Nile Rodgers on Daft Punk's single "Get Lucky", which peaked at number two on the chart. Williams' 2013 single, "Happy"—released for the soundtrack to the animated film Despicable Me 2—became his second song to peak atop the chart within that same year. It also served as the lead single for his second album, Girl (2014), which peaked at number two on the Billboard 200 and saw positive critical reception.
Williams has received numerous accolades and nominations. He has won 13 Grammy Awards, including three for Producer of the Year, Non-Classical (one as a member of the Neptunes).

All charts are ranked by international theatrical box office performance where possible, excluding income derived from home video, broadcasting rights and merchandise.
Animated family films have performed consistently well at the box office, with Disney enjoying lucrative re-releases prior to the home video era with Walt Disney Animation Studios, who have produced films such as Aladdin and The Lion King, both of which were the highest-grossing films of their respective years. Disney Animation also enjoyed later success with the Frozen films and Zootopia in addition to Pixar, of which the films from the Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Incredibles, and Inside Out franchises have been the best performers; beyond Disney and Pixar, franchises such as Shrek, Ice Age, Madagascar, Kung Fu Panda, How to Train Your Dragon, and Despicable Me have met with the most success.


== Highest-grossing animated films ==
The chart below lists the highest-grossing animated films. Figures are given in United States dollars (USD).

Films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket price inflation, population size, and ticket purchasing trends not being considered. If inflation were adjusted for, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs would appear at the top of the chart with an adjusted gross of $1,977,000,000. All except two—The Simpsons Movie and the original 1994 version of The Lion King—are computer-animated films. Despicable Me is the most represented franchise with all six films in the top 50 highest-grossing animated films.

== Background ==
Williams provided vocals for French duo Daft Punk's 2013 album Random Access Memories, on the songs "Lose Yourself to Dance" and "Get Lucky". After returning from the recording sessions in Paris, he attended a meeting with record label managers who said that the results were "spectacular" and that "Get Lucky" would be Daft Punk's next single. They also made Williams an offer to record his own album, to which he agreed quickly, "overwhelmed that someone wanted to know what's in my heart".
On December 17, 2013, it was announced that Williams had signed to Columbia Records and would release his second studio album in 2014.
Williams originally wrote the song for CeeLo Green and felt Green's recording of the song was better, but Elektra Records, Green's record label, decided against it since he was on the verge of releasing his Christmas album, Cee Lo's Magic Moment.


== Composition ==

"Happy" was written and produced by Williams, with backing vocals by Rhea Dummett, Trevon Henderson, Ashley L. Lee, Shamika Hightower, Jasmine Murray and Terrence Rolle. The track was digitally edited and arranged by Andrew Coleman and Mike Larson, who also recorded it with assistance from Matthew Desrameaux at Circle House Studios in Miami, Florida. The song was later mixed by Leslie Brathwaite at Music Box Studios in Atlanta, Georgia.
"Happy" plays for 3 minutes and 53 seconds in common time and at a tempo of 156 beats per minute. The song is written in the key of F minor. Williams sings the upper notes in falsetto; his vocal range spans from F3 to C5. His singing on the track has been compared to that of Curtis Mayfield.
"Happy" is a mid-tempo soul and neo soul song. According to music journalist Paul Tingen, "Happy" is "a mid-tempo ... song in a faux-Motown style, with an arrangement that is, by modern standards, very sparse: programmed drums, one bass and one keyboard part, and handclaps both programmed and played, all topped off by Williams's lead vocals and a whole posse of backing vocals". Jody Rosen viewed the song as a "standout" with a "sprightly neosoul funk groove".

Official website Fly Me to the Moon is a 2024 American period romantic comedy drama film directed by Greg Berlanti from a screenplay by Rose Gilroy, based on a story by Bill Kirstein and Keenan Flynn. The film stars Scarlett Johansson and Channing Tatum in the lead roles, also with Jim Rash, Anna Garcia, Donald Elise Watkins, Noah Robbins, Colin Woodell, Christian Zuber, Nick Dillenburg, Ray Romano, and Woody Harrelson.
The plot follows the relationship between marketing specialist Kelly Jones and the NASA launch director Cole Davis as they are tasked with creating a fictionalized version of the Apollo 11 mission in case the actual one is not successful.
First announced in March 2022, the film was originally set to star Johansson and Chris Evans, with Jason Bateman directing. Tatum and Berlanti replaced Evans and Bateman, respectively, that July, and filming began in Atlanta, Georgia in October.
Fly Me to the Moon premiered on AMC Lincoln Square in New York City on July 8, 2024, and was released theatrically in the United States by Sony Pictures Releasing on July 12. The film received mixed reviews from critics and has grossed $39 million worldwide against a budget of $100
million, making it a box-office bomb.


== Plot ==
During the 1960s Space Race between the United States and the Soviet Union, a relationship develops between the NASA director in charge of the Apollo 11 launch and the marketing specialist brought in to fix NASA's public image and stage a "back-up" fake Moon landing.

== Production ==
In March 2022, Apple Studios announced they had acquired the rights to produce a movie set in the backdrop of the Space Race, then titled of Project Artemis, for more than $100 million. Scarlett Johansson and Chris Evans were also announced as starring in the film, with Jason Bateman directing. In May, Bateman said the working title Project Artemis was likely to change. He left the project the following month, citing creative differences, and was later replaced by Greg Berlanti, his first directorial effort since 2018's Love, Simon.
Screenwriter Rose Gilroy referenced the book Marketing the Moon for her writing. She says the book "is about the original ads that were used, and how sci-fi was woven into the minds of the American people" using genre books and movies "That was instrumental. It was endlessly interesting to learn all the ways they sold" the Apollo 11 mission.
The search for a new director and Berlanti's availability changed the production schedule, forcing Evans to drop out as well. In July, Channing Tatum entered into negotiations to replace him. In September, Jim Rash joined the cast. Ray Romano, Anna Garcia, and Woody Harrelson would be added in the following months.
Principal photography began on October 27, 2022, in Atlanta, with a casting call issued seeking extras to play NASA employees and FBI agents. By December 21, 2023, with a release date of July 12, 2024 set, the film was no longer titled Project Artemis. In April 2024, the film's new title was revealed to be Fly Me to the Moon, and Daniel Pemberton was confirmed to compose the score for the film.


== Release ==
The film was initially slated to be released direct-to-streaming on Apple TV+ but was redirected to theatrical following strong test screenings. Following their partnership on Napoleon, Apple entered into another agreement with Sony Pictures to distribute the film in cinemas in December 2023, after both Warner Bros. declined to bid for theatrical distribution rights with Paramount saying they already had full release schedules. Sony Pictures scheduled the film for a theatrical release in the United States and Canada on July 12, 2024.
