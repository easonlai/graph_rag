He and Lucy are partnered and stationed at a shopping mall, with a cupcake store as their front.\\nGru immediately suspects that Mexican restaurant owner Eduardo Pérez might be \"El Macho\", a supervillain who was presumed dead after riding a shark into an active volcano with two hundred fifty pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest. That night, Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo\\'s restaurant, but find no evidence that Eduardo has done anything villainous. Meanwhile, Gru\\'s three adopted daughters, Margo, Edith and Agnes, who dream of having a mother one day, believe that Gru will eventually fall in love with Lucy. Gru denies it, saying his relationship with Lucy is only professional.\\nDespite holding Eduardo as his prime suspect, Gru agrees to pursue other leads, including the shop of wig merchant Floyd Eaglesan, where Lucy discovers traces of the mutagen. After witnessing Eduardo\\'s son, Antonio, woo Margo, Gru renews his focus on Eduardo, who in turn invites the family to his Cinco de Mayo party.

They have one or two eyes, and their irises are almost always brown (except for Bob, who has one green and one brown eye). They have three fingers and toes per hand and foot. They have no discernible noses but seem capable of smelling, as they are shown smelling fruit and are affected by the Fart Gun. They are also shown without ears but can hear and respond to sounds.  Most Minions appear either bald or with a few wispy strands of black hair on their heads. After leaving their home country of Switzerland in favor of a new life in America during the late 1960s, their clothing consists of blue overalls emblazoned with Gru\\'s logo, black rubber gloves, shoes, and goggles.\\nWhile shown as somewhat absent-minded and having very mischievous streaks, they also possess exceptional engineering abilities, being able to design and construct spaceships and playthings for Gru\\'s adopted daughters, particularly the youngest, Agnes. The 2015 animated feature film Minions shows that they have existed since the beginning of life on Earth. Minions are biologically wired to seek out and serve villains – including notable fictional ones such as Count Dracula, and real-life historical figures like Napoleon – and when they have no \"boss\" to serve, the Minions become depressed and listless. They are also shown to have a degree of invulnerability, as Kevin, Stuart and Bob are able to survive a European torture chamber without any injuries, even playing with the torture devices, and to survive being hit by dropped heavy objects. In the 2010 short film \"Banana\", the Minions are revealed to have an almost uncontrollable craving for fruit, especially bananas.\\n\\n\\n== Language ==\\nThe Minions speak in a fictional polyglot language, called Minionese, which features a combination of gibberish mixed with words from real languages such as but not limited to English, French, Spanish, Indonesian, Hindi, Korean, Filipino and Italian. Although seemingly nonsensical, the English-sounding dialogue is dubbed differently for every country, in order to make the sounds somewhat recognizable.  They have common English-language names, such as Dave (one of the first known minions in the franchise), Kevin, Stuart, Bob (the lead trio in Minions and Minions: The Rise of Gru), Mel (the leader of the Minions in Despicable Me 3 after Gru refuses their request to resume supervillainy), and Otto (the fourth lead Minion in Minions: The Rise of Gru).\\n\\n\\n== Derivatives ==\\n\\nSince the release of the Despicable Me films, the Minions\\' popularity has been rising. The Minions have been regularly featured in cross-promotions for other Comcast/NBCUniversal properties, including Universal theme parks, NBC primetime TV series, and an Xfinity remote control.\\n\"Minion versions\" of the Simpson family appeared at the end of The Simpsons episode \"Treehouse of Horror XXV\", which aired on October 19, 2014.\\nThe Minions appeared in three epis', metadata={'title': 'Minions (Despicable Me)', 'summary': 'Minions () are a fictional all-male species of yellow creatures that appear in Illumination\\'s Despicable Me franchise.

After leaving, he founded Illumination Entertainment and a deal was announced positioning Illumination Entertainment as Universal\\'s family entertainment arm, that would produce one to two films a year starting in 2010. As part of the deal, Illumination retains creative control and Universal Pictures exclusively distributes the films.\\nIn 2011, Illumination acquired the animation department of the French animation and visual effects studio Mac Guff, which animated Despicable Me and Dr. Seuss\\' The Lorax, and formed Illumination Mac Guff (later Illumination Studios Paris).\\nOn August 22, 2016, NBCUniversal acquired competing studio DreamWorks Animation, which fueled speculation that Meledandri was to oversee both studios. While he had been approached by NBCUniversal to oversee both studios, he turned down the offer and later explained \"I love the process of making films and working with artists. I don\\'t think I\\'m particularly great at managing companies\".\\nOn September 23, 2022, Illumination announced its hiring of former Netflix head of adult animation Mike Moon as senior creative advisor, and a new label led by Moon known as Moonlight, which will aim to \"produce animated films that push beyond the family genre\".\\n\\n\\n== Process ==\\nIn a similar fashion to Sony Pictures Animation and Warner Bros. Pictures Animation, Illumination does not produce its films in-house where it is based in Santa Monica, but rather outsources the animation production of its films to other studios. Most of its films are animated by Illumination Studios Paris, a subsidiary formed through the purchase of Mac Guff (which animated the first Despicable Me). So far, the only Illumination film not to be animated by Illumination Studios Paris or Mac Guff was Hop, which was animated by Rhythm & Hues Studios.\\nNot unlike Pixar, in its early days Illumination depended on a core group of directors and writers to create its films. The directors of Despicable Me, Pierre Coffin and Chris Renaud, also directed or co-directed Dr. Seuss\\' The Lorax, Despicable Me 2, Minions, The Secret Life of Pets, and Despicable Me 3. Screenwriters Cinco Paul and Ken Daurio (who had written Dr. Seuss\\' Horton Hears a Who! for Meledandri at Fox) wrote or co-wrote Despicable Me, Hop, Dr. Seuss\\' The Lorax, Despicable Me 2, The Secret Life of Pets, and Despicable Me 3, while screenwriter Brian Lynch wrote or co-wrote Hop, Minions, and The Secret Life of Pets.\\nIllumination\\'s films generally have a budget between $60–80 million.

       " Document(page_content='Felonious Gru Sr., alternatively spelled as Felonius Gru and typically referred to simply as Gru, is a fictional character and the  protagonist of the Despicable Me franchise. Voiced by American actor Steve Carell, he has appeared in all six films in the series. Gru is a grouchy, quick-witted, and cynical former supervillain, who serves as a secret agent in order to fight other supervillains.\\n\\n\\n== Character biography ==\\n\\nGru is the son of Marlena and the Bald Terror (real name Robert), twin brother of Dru, the adoptive father of Margo, Edith, and Agnes as well as the biological father of Gru Jr., husband of Lucy, and boss of the Minions.\\nAt the beginning of the first film, Gru is an ambitious supervillain who constantly seeks approval from his mother, until the adoption of his daughters convinces him that their happiness is the most important thing.\\nIn the second film, Gru leaves his villainous past behind to care for his adoptive daughters, but then soon joins forces - unwillingly - with secret agent Lucy Wilde, whom he later marries.\\nIn the third film, after he and Lucy are fired from their jobs at the Anti-Villain League, Gru learns that he has a twin brother, Dru, whom he never met due to their divorced parents raising each child separately. Along with Lucy and the girls, Gru meets Dru at his mansion in Freedonia, and they form a brotherly relationship over the course of the film.\\nIn the fourth film, Gru has a blood-related son called Felonious Gru Jr., who he must protect from his rival Maxime Le Mal.\\n\\n\\n== Development ==\\nThe character that would become Gru was conceived by animator Sergio Pablos, who envisioned him as a Dracula-like character, but the directors of the first film, Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin, later opted for a more sleek character that would echo \"the world of James Bond\", with Auric Goldfinger being cited as a particular influence. Gru also bears some design similarities with British comic-book character Grimly Feendish and with the pre-Crisis version of Lex Luthor.\\nGru\\'s distinctive accent, described as \"quasi-Russian\" by A. O. Scott and \"halfway between a Russian mafioso and a crazed Nazi\" by Roger Ebert, was largely a product of his voice actor Steve Carell\\'s experimentation. According to Despicable Me producer Chris Meledandri, the voice Carell eventually settled on was conceived as \"halfway between Ricardo Montalbán and Bela Lugosi\".\\n\\n\\n== Analysis ==\\nThe use of flashbacks to characterise Gru in Despicable Me was compared by Variety to those used in Pixar\\'s 2007 film Ratatouille to characterise Anton Ego. Gru was cited by Katy Marriner, writing in Screen Education, as one of the premier examples of a protagonist in an animated film who reforms themself, in contrast to the traditional animated film protagonist who remains heroic throughout. Gru was psychologically analysed by Nofika Dewi of Universitas Pamulang, who found that his rude and ambitious qualities represented his Id; his villainy and tenaciousness represented his Ego, while his competence as a parent and bravery were part of his Super-ego.\\nGru has also been interpreted as a Russian stereotype, with a 2017 study stating that elements of his characterisation had been designed to support supposed American political agendas that label Russians as backwards and violent.\\n\\n\\n== References ==\\n\\n\\n== Further reading ==\\nDiane Hughes; Mark Evans, eds.

He has received nominations for two Academy Awards for the Ice Age short film No Time for Nuts (2006) and Despicable Me 2 (2013).\\n\\n\\n== Life and career ==\\nChris Renaud was born in 1966 in Baltimore. At age 15, he moved to Bethlehem, Pennsylvania when his father, who worked for Bethlehem Steel, was transferred to their corporate headquarters. Renaud has said he had mixed feelings with the move, saying it upset him but it was also one of the best things in his life because it showed him \"that there was a great, big world out there\". He was the artist for the high school yearbooks and newspaper and had aspirations of creating comic books. He graduated Parkland High School in Allentown, Pennsylvania in 1985 and attended Baum School of Art in Allentown, where he received a $1,000 scholarship.\\nAfter graduating from Syracuse University with an illustration degree in 1989,  Renaud began work as a graphic designer in the sports entertainment industry. He has created logos and mascots for NFL Properties, the NBA, and Foot Locker. After working as a designer and illustrator for a variety of publications and agencies, Chris began drawing and writing comic books. Working for both Marvel Comics and DC Comics, his projects included illustrating Marvel\\'s Starfleet Academy and pitching the story concept that evolved into Batman: Cataclysm which depicted a devastating earthquake hitting Gotham City. This yearlong tale across all Batman-related comics resulted in increased sales and visibility for the renowned character and set up the acclaimed \"No Man\\'s Land\" storyline that followed.\\nAs the production designer on the Disney Channel\\'s The Book of Pooh, Renaud transitioned into the world of children\\'s television. Since that groundbreaking project, he has been able to design virtual sets and puppet characters for Bear in the Big Blue House, LazyTown, Curious Pictures and Sony Pictures Animation. With It\\'s a Big Big World, which aired from 2006 to 2010 on PBS, he took the lead in visual development and design of every aspect of this Emmy-nominated children\\'s program.\\nRenaud worked for Blue Sky Studios as a story artist on the films Robots, Ice Age: The Meltdown, and the Dr. Seuss adaptation Horton Hears a Who!. He wrote and co-directed the animated short No Time for Nuts, which received an Annie Award and a 2007 Oscar nomination for animated short film. It was also included in the Animation Show of Shows in 2006.\\nRenaud moved to Paris to work for Illumination Entertainment. While directing Despicable Me (2010), Renaud, along with his directing partner Pierre Coffin, began to develop Gru\\'s famous henchmen, the Minions. Initially, there were discussions about making the creatures robots. Then Renaud hit upon the notion that they could be mole people and slapped goggles on them. \"I did a very rough, ugly, little sketch combining some elements into a mole person and sent it to Pierre, who then discussed it with Eric Guillon, who was the art director and final designer of the Minions, and they took some of those ideas and together we came up with what the Minions look like\". The more the filmmakers worked on the little guys, the more yellow and more cylindrical they became. \"Eric continued to refine the idea and made [the Minions] closer to children. He made them funnier and simpler and a brighter color\".

He is the son of Marlena and the Bald Terror (real name Robert), twin brother of Dru, the adoptive father of Margo, Edith, and Agnes as well as the biological father of Gru Jr., husband of Lucy, and boss of the Minions. In the first film, Gru is an ambitious supervillain who constantly seeks approval from his mother, until the adoption of his daughters convinces him that their happiness is the most important thing. In the second film, Gru leaves his villainous past behind to care for his adoptive daughters, but then soon joins forces - unwillingly - with secret agent Lucy Wilde, whom he later marries. In the third film, after he and Lucy are fired from their jobs at the Anti-Villain League, Gru learns that he has a twin brother, Dru, whom he never met due to their divorced parents raising each child separately.
